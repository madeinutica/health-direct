ntegrating insurance and accepted plans is essential for making the directory functional.

Based on our previous design, here is how we can seamlessly integrate this new, critical data.

1. 🆕 New Module: "My Profile & Insurance"
Before, we had a simple "Settings" icon. This now becomes a full-fledged "Profile" module, and its primary job is to store the user's insurance plan.

User Flow:

The user taps the "Profile" icon (which replaces "Settings") on the "Home" tab.

They see a section: "My Health Plan" with an "Add Insurance" button.

Tapping this opens a search screen where they can find their insurer (e.g., "Fidelis Care," "Excellus," "Aetna") and, optionally, their specific plan.

This screen must also include simple, top-level toggles for "I have Medicaid" and "I have Medicare" for users who identify with the program, not a specific managed care company.

Once added, their plan is saved to the app.

Why this is crucial: By having the user save their plan once, we can create a powerful, personalized "In-Network" filter that works across the entire app.

2. 🔄 Updated Modules & Screens
Here is how saving an insurance plan changes the rest of the application layout.

1. Updated: "Home" Tab
Smart Banner: The moment the app opens, it checks if insurance is saved.

If NO plan is saved: A banner appears at the top: "Add your insurance to see providers in your network." Tapping it goes to the "My Profile" module.

If a plan IS saved: A small label appears under the "Home" title: "Active Plan: [Fidelis Care]" with a "Change" link.

2. Updated: "Search" & "Results List"
This is where the biggest change happens. The filter system becomes paramount.

New "Filter" Button: Every results list (e.g., after tapping "Urgent Care" or searching "Cardiology") now has a prominent "Filter" button.

The Filter Screen: Tapping "Filter" opens a new screen with these options:

"In-Network Only" (Toggle): This is the master switch. If the user has a saved plan, this is ON by default. It automatically filters the list to only show providers who accept the user's saved plan.

"Accepts Medicaid" (Checkbox): A specific, high-level filter.

"Accepts Medicare" (Checkbox): Another high-level filter.

Manual Insurance Search: A search bar to manually filter by any insurance, in case the user is searching for a family member.

Updated Provider Card: The card in the results list now has a new component.

NEW: "In-Network" Badge: If the user has a saved plan and this provider accepts it, a small, green "✅ In-Network" badge appears on the card. This provides immediate, scannable confirmation.

3. Updated: "Provider Detail" Page
This screen becomes the "source of truth" for all insurance questions.

NEW: "Insurance & Plans" Section: This is now one of the most important sections on the page, placed high up (e.g., right under "Locations").

Smart Display:

If user has a saved plan: The very first item is a high-contrast box: "✅ Accepts your plan: [Fidelis Care]".

If user has NO saved plan (or the provider is out-of-network): The box will say "❌ May not accept your plan" or "ℹ️ Check plans below".

Full Plan List:

Below this smart display, the page lists all accepted plans.

This section must have its own search bar (e.g., "Search accepted plans...") because a provider might accept hundreds.

It will display "Medicaid" and "Medicare" as top-level, easy-to-see tags if they are accepted.

4. Updated: "Map View" Tab
Filter Integration: The "Filter" button on the map now opens the same filter screen from the Results List.

User Flow: A user can open the map, tap "Filter," toggle "In-Network Only," and all the out-of-network provider pins will be hidden, simplifying the view instantly.
